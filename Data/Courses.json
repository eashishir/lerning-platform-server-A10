    "details": "JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language used to make webpages interactive (e.g., having complex animations, clickable buttons, popup menus, etc.). There are also more advanced server side versions of JavaScript such as Node.js, which allow you to add more functionality to a website than downloading files (such as realtime collaboration between multiple computers). Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over them.JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements such as operators, control structures, and statements."

    "details": "A JavaScript variable is simply a name of storage location.There are two types of variables in JavaScript : local variable and global variable.There are some rules while declaring a JavaScript variable (also known as identifiers).1:Name must start with a letter (a to z or A to Z), underscore( _ ), or dollar( $ ) sign. 2:After first letter we can use digits (0 to 9),for example value1.3:JavaScript variables are case sensitive, for example x and X are different variables."

    "details": "There’s a special syntax to work with promises in a more comfortable fashion, called “async/await”. It’s surprisingly easy to understand and use.The word “async” before a function means one simple thing: a function always returns a promise. Other values are wrapped in a resolved promise automatically.So, async ensures that the function returns a promise, and wraps non-promises in it. Simple enough, right? But not only that. There’s another keyword, await, that works only inside async functions, and it’s pretty cool.The keyword await makes JavaScript wait until that promise settles and returns its result.The function execution “pauses” at the line (*) and resumes when the promise settles, with result becoming its result. So the code above shows “done!” in one second.Let’s emphasize: await literally suspends the function execution until the promise settles, and then resumes it with the promise result. That doesn’t cost any CPU resources, because the JavaScript engine can do other jobs in the meantime: execute other scripts, handle events, etc.It’s just a more elegant syntax of getting the promise result than promise.then. And, it’s easier to read and write."
